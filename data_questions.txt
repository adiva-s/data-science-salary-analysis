Problem Statements

1. What is the overall trend in Data Science salaries from 2021 to 2023 - US based?
    
    Data Analysts - MI

    Year 2020
    Row 3731 - 85,000 USD (Large)
    
    Year 2021
    Row 3528 - 135,000 USD (Large)

    Year 2022 
    Row 2167 - 97,500 USD (Large)

    -> The increase in salary from 2020 to 2021 shows substantial salary growth for Mid-Level Data Analysts in Large companies, 
    potentially suggesting a strong demand for professionals in this role. The decrease in salary from 2021 to 2022 can be accounted
    from changes in the job market or company circumstances etc. 

    Data Analysts - SE

    Year 2021
    Row 3649 - 200,000 USD (Large)

    Year 2022
    Row 2180 - 113,00 USD (Large)

    Year 2023 
    Row 578 - 202,800 USD (Large)

    -> Unlike the previous examples when comparing MI experience level, there was a decrease in salary from 2021 to 2022, with an 
    increase in salary from 2022 to 2023. The reasons/factors are, of course, unknown - but it could be possible the COVID 19 
    pandemic could result in the decrease of salary (economic uncertainty, job market fluctuations such as job demand/). While the 
    recovery from the pandemic's impact signalling the economy's improvement shows in the increase in salary. 
  

2. How does company size (Large, Medium, Small) relate to salaries?
    From looking at the US in the Data Scientist Role, the company size doesn't necessarily correlate with salaries. Some companies
    that are considered Large offer smaller salaries compared to companies that are considered Medium. Row 2220 shows how a Large 
    company offers 153,000 USD while Row 2472 shows a Medium company offers 173,000 USD. Row 2185 shows a Medium company offering 225,000 USD. 

    Similary when looking at the Data Engineer Role based in the US, row 3672 shows a Medium sized company offering a salary of
    165,000 USD. Row 3544 of a Large company offers a salary of 90,000 USD. Row 3552 similarly shows a Large company with a salary of 140,000 USD.
    Row 3492 shows a Large company with a salary of 72,500 USD. On the other hand, Row 3638 shows a Small company with a salary of 115,000 USD. 

3. How do salaries vary by experience level (EN = entry level, EX = experienced, MI = Mid-Level, SE = senior)?
    Using the example for Data Engineers in the US from Question 2, Row 3492 shows a Large company with a salary of 72,500 USD. Meanwhile, 
    Row 3638 shows a Small company with a salary of 115,000 USD. However, when looking at the experience level for Rows 3492 and 3638, 
    Row 3492 is entry level while Row 3638 is senior. When looking at Data Scientists, Row 2220 shows an experience level of mid-level 
    with a salary of 153,000 USD. While Row 2472 shows an experience of Senior with a salary of 173,000 USD. 
    
    This highlights an important point about salary determinants - experience level trumps company size in salary determination. 
    From comparing the salaries and experience level of Row 3638 which is a senior-level position and Row 3492 which is an entry-level position, 
    the salary difference emphasizes how an individual with more experience tends to recevie higher compensation due to their expertise.

Conclusion: 
    In examining Data Science salaries from various perspectives, it is evident that salary determination is a multifaceted
    process influenced by a multitude of factors. It can be tempting for individuals to simplify salary consideration by focusing 
    mainly on one or two aspects. However, in studying this data set, the data shows the complexity of this matter. 

    Starting with salary trends over times particularly in Data Analysts, from 2020 to 2021, there was substantial salary growth
    for Mid-Level Data Analysts in Large companies, suggesting a demand for data analysts. There was, however, a decrease in 2022.
    This serves as a reminder that external factors (job market changes or company-specific circumstances) can result in salary 
    fluctuations. But more importantly, this highlights the relevance of paying attention to industry trends when understanding
    salary dynamics. 

    In examining the correlation between company size and salary determination, it is concluded that company size alone does not 
    determine salary range. In fact, some Large companies offered samaller salaries compared to Medium or Small companies. These 
    observations emphasize how factors beyond company size influence salary determination. 

    When looking at company size, and salary determination, experience level was compared. For instance, looking at Data Engineer 
    salaries for Row 3492 (entry level) and Row 3628 (senior) show that both positions are in Large companies but the salary
    disparity shows that experience/expertise are pivotal factors in compensatoin. It emphasizes the value that professionals bring
    to the company, and furthermore the significance of skill development/career progression for positions in Data Science. 

    To conclude, this analysis underscores the nuanced and intricate process of salary determinants in Data Sciences. Not one factor
    alone truly influences salary range. Rather every aspect is one piece of a larger puzzles. These insights serve as a reminder 
    to individuals interested in the Data Science job market to take a holistic approach, considering every aspect when considering
    compensation and while achieving career aspirations. 

    The journey toward understanding Data Science salaries is an ongoing process, and these analyses represent a valuable stepping 
    stone toward a more comprehensive understanding of this complex field.
